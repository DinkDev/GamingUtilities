## ExtractImages.ps1
A PowerShell script to extract images and thier alpha masks from a PDF file!
This is a great utility to get base images for creating online RPG tokens.

Uses the Xpdf command line tools available at https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html
And NConvert command line available at https://www.xnview.com/en/nconvert/

(Also, works well with Paint.NET and BoltBait's Plugin Pack - especially the Paste Alpha function
